This project is a simple portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.   We followed an Agile workflow using GitHub Projects (Kanban board) to track progress.   Each feature was developed in a separate branch and merged via pull requests.   Tasks like header, footer, and setup were tracked and reviewed before final merge.
